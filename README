Initial work on this module was done by Nicholas Campbell and Derik Stiller. Clientside work initially done by Dan Pozmanter.

--------------------
Usage
--------------------
To use this tool you should only have to do the following.

- Put the files in the ximple-forms directory under modules.
- Add 'ximple-forms' to your list of modules in your app.properties file for your application.
- Create a XimpleForm prototype within your application and make sure that 'content' is called from within that prototypes main function.

--------------------
Skinning
--------------------
There is not yet a notion of a main wrapper function (tal or JS). Thus, you need to create one. I'll likely have to include one at some point so look for it in the future.
